anyway the file is like 400Mb so i'm not going to do this with pen and paper.
lets see if i car write a interpreter.
---
written a script to remove all the uninteresting lines to reduce file size

also decided it's probably a bad idea to load the whole thing in memmory,
i already had to reboot once because i opened it in atom and my trusty piece
antique froze up on me.
so i decided to cat the file and pipe to the script.

file: stripfile.py

usage: stripfile.py 

---
noticed that there is only 5 bits available for the address maximum of 32 addresses
got a bit worried that there was a strange hack going on
because in the picture i see more than 32 lines on the matrix
but then i remembered that there are 2 lines written at the same time so i
think we're good..
----

--------------
i stept into my hyperfocus bubble and wrote a parser
note on that are as comments in the code

got stuck for a bit because i thought that the OE needed to be troggled for output
but as soon as kicked that bit of code out of my script every thing showed up fine
file: blink.py

usage:
      cat blink.csv or stripped.csv to

----------------
got a flag

flag is in catme.txt ;-)
